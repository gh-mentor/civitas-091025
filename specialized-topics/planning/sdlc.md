## Designing a Web-Based Invoicing Application with ASP.NET Web API and ReactJS

My team consists of experienced .NET C# developers. I need step-by-step guidance to design a web-based invoicing application with the following requirements:

1. Build a RESTful API for managing invoices and clients.
2. Use MongoDB (NoSQL) for data storage.
3. Implement invoice management logic for adding/removing invoice items and clients.
4. Generate billing and ageing reports.
5. Create a user-friendly interface for invoice management.
6. Set up secure authentication and authorization.
7. Implement robust error handling and logging.

**Instructions:**
- Recommend tools, frameworks, and libraries for each task and explain why.
- Outline workflows, prerequisites, and dependencies for each step.
- Highlight best practices for scalability, maintainability, and security.
- Add diagrams or architecture visuals if useful.
- List common pitfalls and how to avoid them.
- Summarize the workflow at the end.
- Don't include any sample code.

**Format:**
- Numbered steps per task.
- Bullet points for tools and best practices.
- Use headings for sections.
- Keep explanations concise and actionable.

**Goal:**  
Enable my team to confidently execute each phase of the invoicing application project with a clear understanding of tools, workflows, and security.
````

```
I also need help creating a test plan for the invoicing application that includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. My team has experience using MSTest. The application is built using C# with ASP.NET Core for the backend and ReactJS for the frontend. The test plan should include:
- Test objectives
- Test strategy
- Test environment
- Test schedule
- Test resources
- Test deliverables
```

## System Planning,  Design, and Implementation for Azure Infrastructure
```

2. Set up a web server.
3. Add a load balancer.
4. Set up a database server.
5. Configure networking (VPC, subnets, security groups).
6. Implement infrastructure security.

**Instructions:**
- Recommend Azure tools/services for each task and explain why.
- Outline workflows, prerequisites, and dependencies.
- Highlight best practices for scalability, reliability, and security.
- Add diagrams if useful.
- List common pitfalls and how to avoid them.
- Summarize the workflow at the end.

**Format:**
- Numbered steps per task.
- Bullet points for tools and best practices.
- Use headings for sections.
- Keep explanations brief and actionable.

**Goal:**  
Help my team confidently execute each task with clear understanding of tools, workflows, and security.
