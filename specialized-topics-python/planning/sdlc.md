## Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

```
I am an experienced Python software engineer and would like an overview how GitHub Copilot can be integrated into the software development life cycle.
- Provide a detailed explanation of how Copilot can assist in each phase of the SDLC, including planning, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
- Include specific examples of tasks or activities within each phase where Copilot can be particularly beneficial for Python projects.

## Designing a Web-Based Invoicing Application with ASP.NET Web API and ReactJS

```
My team consists of experienced .NET C# developers. I need step-by-step guidance to design a web-based invoicing application with the following requirements:

1. Build a RESTful API for managing invoices and clients.
2. Use MongoDB (NoSQL) for data storage.
3. Implement invoice management logic for adding/removing invoice items and clients.
4. Generate billing and ageing reports.
5. Create a user-friendly interface for invoice management.
6. Set up secure authentication and authorization.
7. Implement robust error handling and logging.

**Instructions:**
- Recommend tools, frameworks, and libraries for each task and explain why.
- Outline workflows, prerequisites, and dependencies for each step.
- Highlight best practices for scalability, maintainability, and security.
- Add diagrams or architecture visuals if useful.
- List common pitfalls and how to avoid them.
- Summarize the workflow at the end.
- Don't include any sample code.

**Format:**
- Numbered steps per task.
- Bullet points for tools and best practices.
- Use headings for sections.
- Keep explanations concise and actionable.

**Goal:**  
Enable my team to confidently execute each phase of the invoicing application project with a clear understanding of tools, workflows, and security.
````


```
I also need help creating a test plan for the invoicing application that includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. My team has experience using pytest. The application is built using Python (Django or FastAPI) for the backend and ReactJS for the frontend. The test plan should include:
- Test objectives
- Test strategy
- Test environment
- Test schedule
- Test resources
- Test deliverables

**Instructions:**
- List the required components of a comprehensive test plan for a web-based invoicing application.
- Briefly describe what should be included in each component.
- Focus on Python (Django or FastAPI) and ReactJS, using pytest for testing.


**Format:**
- Numbered or bulleted list for each test plan component.
- Concise explanations for each item.

**Goal:**
Ensure the test plan provides comprehensive coverage and clear guidance for testing all aspects of the invoicing application, enabling the team to deliver a robust, reliable, and maintainable Python (Django or FastAPI) and ReactJS solution.
