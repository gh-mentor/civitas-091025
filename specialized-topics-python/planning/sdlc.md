## Using GitHub Copilot Throughout the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

```
I am an experienced Python software engineer. I want to understand how to effectively use GitHub Copilot throughout the software development life cycle (SDLC) for a web-based invoicing application.

- For each SDLC phase (planning, design, development, testing, deployment, maintenance), explain:
  - Specific ways Copilot can assist or accelerate tasks in that phase.
  - Example prompts or workflows to use with Copilot.
  - Best practices for maximizing Copilotâ€™s effectiveness.
  - Limitations or pitfalls to watch for when using Copilot.
- Focus on practical, actionable advice for Python (Django or FastAPI) and ReactJS projects.
- Use concise bullet points and numbered lists.
- Do not include sample code.

**Goal:**  
Help my team leverage GitHub Copilot to improve productivity, code quality, and collaboration at every stage of the SDLC.

## Designing a Web-Based Invoicing Application with Node.js and ReactJS

```
My team consists of experienced TypeScript developers. I need step-by-step guidance to design a web-based invoicing application with the following requirements:

1. Build a RESTful API for managing invoices and clients.
2. Use MongoDB (NoSQL) for data storage.
3. Implement invoice management logic for adding/removing invoice items and clients.
4. Generate billing and ageing reports.
5. Create a user-friendly interface for invoice management.
6. Set up secure authentication and authorization.
7. Implement robust error handling and logging.

**Instructions:**
- Recommend tools, frameworks, and libraries for each task and explain why.
- Outline workflows, prerequisites, and dependencies for each step.
- Highlight best practices for scalability, maintainability, and security.
- Add diagrams or architecture visuals if useful.
- List common pitfalls and how to avoid them.
- Summarize the workflow at the end.
- Don't include any sample code.

**Format:**
- Numbered steps per task.
- Bullet points for tools and best practices.
- Use headings for sections.
- Keep explanations concise and actionable.

**Goal:**  
Enable my team to confidently execute each phase of the invoicing application project with a clear understanding of tools, workflows, and security.
