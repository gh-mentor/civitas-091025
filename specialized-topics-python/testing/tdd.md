```
Create a pytest unit test for a Python class `Employees`.
The class has a method `high_earners` that returns a list of employees who earn more than 100,000.
The Employee class has a name and a salary. The method should return a list of employees who earn more than 100,000.
Edge cases:
The test should include a test case where the list is empty, and another where the list has one employee. In both cases, the method should return an empty list.
The response must include the unit test and a sample Employees class with the `high_earners` method.
```

```
Modify the Employees class to include a `high_earners` method that accepts a function (lambda) strategy in the form: `lambda salary: bool`.
Update the unit test class to test the modified `high_earners` method.
```

```
Show me a folder structure for this example.
