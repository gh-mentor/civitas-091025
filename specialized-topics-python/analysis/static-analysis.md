
### Python

- Recommend static analysis tools for a Python project. The tool should be capable of identifying security vulnerabilities and code quality issues.

- I need a quick review of Bandit with key features and limitations. Also include a sample Bandit command to scan a Python project.

- How do I implement Bandit for a Python project built using VS Code?

- How do I integrate Bandit into my CI/CD pipeline for automated security checks with GitHub Actions?

- What are some other static analysis tools for Python (e.g., pylint, flake8, mypy) and what are their strengths and weaknesses for code quality and security?

- Show a sample GitHub Actions workflow that runs Bandit and pylint on every push and pull request, and fails the build if any security issues are found.

- How do I integrate the SARIF report into GitHub's Security tab?
