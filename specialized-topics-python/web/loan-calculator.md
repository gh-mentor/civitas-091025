Create an HTML web page that displays a loan calculator.
Details:
The form should have the following fields:
- Loan Amount (text input)
- Annual Interest Rate (dropdown list box includes values in the range from 5.0 to 8.0 in increments of 0.5)
- Loan Term (text input)
- Monthly Payment (text input, disabled)
Requirements:
- The form should use bootstrap for styling.
- The form should use progressive web app styling to display on various devices
- The form should have a button 'calculate' that when clicked, calculates the monthly mortgage payment, and displays the result on the page.
- The calculation should be based on the standard amortization formula in an inline script tag in the HTML file.
- The form should not allow the user to click the 'calculate' button if any of the form fields are empty.

Separate the script section into a separate JavaScript module 'calc.js'. Change the web form accordingly.
